### Java, Socket Programming, Multithreading, File I/O, Concurrent Data Structures, CLI Tools
• Developed a multi-threaded group chat application in Java using TCP socket programming, enabling real-time
communication among multiple clients.

• Implemented custom protocol commands like /users, /history, and @username for user listing, chat log retrieval, and
private messaging.

• Used ConcurrentHashMap and CopyOnWriteArrayList to manage active clients and ensure thread-safe message
dispatching.

• Built a persistent server-side chat history system using file I/O to store and serve recent messages on request.

• Handled client disconnection and cleanup of sockets and streams to prevent memory leaks and ensure server stability.
